- The algorithm :ref:`DiscusMultipleScatteringCorrection <algm-DiscusMultipleScatteringCorrection>` now simulates scattering in a container (and more generally in any sample environment components) if a user sets up the shapes\materials in the input workspace prior to running the algorithm. As part of this work the previous requirement that the :math:`S(Q,\omega)` profile must have some non-zero values for :math:`\omega`<0 has been removed.
