New Features
------------



Bugfixes
--------
- Scaling for waterfall plots has been fixed for scaling in log scale plots
- Opening multiple instances of Mantid in quick succession will no longer cause errors in the shared settings.
- A large number of crashes have been fixed caused by opening an Algorithm Dialog and populating it with a WorkspaceGroup.
- It is no longer possible to crash mantid when opening an interface's help documentation for the second time.
- The ISIS logos have been updated to match the UKRI rebrand.
- Fix a change in behaviour after upgrading Qt where floating point numbers in
  the matrix data view were not displayed unless the column was wide enough to show
  all digits.


InstrumentViewer
----------------

New features
############


Bugfixes
############
- The instrument view startup time has been improved by avoid checking for masking
  if it is not present.


SliceViewer
-----------

New features
############


Bugfixes
############
- Fix for colorbar when using log scale that causes slice viewer to throw exception with all masked slice.
- The colorbar now remains autoscaled when switching between the different normalisation options.
- SliceViewer will now support `W_MATRIX` log for nonorthogonal axes with MDHistoWorkspaces. This prevents a bug related where basis vectors are used to calculate the projection.
- Fixes a bug in the SliceViewer where a workspace is replaced by an algorithm
  with more than one output workspace.
